// Backends used to read their pins, geometry and driver selection straight out
// of build macros at construction time, which meant a binary could drive
// exactly one panel. Several boards ship with more than one: the Xteink X3/X4
// changed panel controller mid-production, the T-Display P4 has variants that
// differ only in their init sequence, and the T-Embed and T-Embed CC1101 differ
// only in pinout. One binary that picks the right panel at boot is cheaper than
// one build per variant, and these devices have the flash to spare.
//
// So the macros no longer feed the constructor. They seed this struct, once, at
// static-init time; the backend reads the struct in begin(). Anything that runs
// before begin() — a board's _setup_gpio(), a probe of the panel's ID register
// — can overwrite it, and the display comes up as whatever the struct says.
//
// A board that has only ever had one panel does not have to do anything: its
// macros still describe it, and the seeded values are what they always were.
